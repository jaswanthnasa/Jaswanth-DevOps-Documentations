💡Obervability --------> internal state of system [app, infra, network]

disk utilization, cpu utilization, memory utilization
Number of success/failed http requests towards application

3 pillars of Observability
what--->metrics
why---->logs
how---->traces

Metrics---------> Historical data of application [cpu utilization for last 3 months]
logs------------> some amt of information
traces----------> extensive amt of information


==========================
Monitoring vs Observability
==========================

Monitoring------> metrics + alerts + Dashboards.
    Only one pillar of Observability --metrics   
    its an subset of Observability

====================================


Metrics -----------> measurements or data points that tell you what is happening. 
		    For example, the number of steps you walk each day, your heart rate, or the temperature outside—these are all metrics.

Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting

Exporters---> addons/plug-ins in Promotheus using which it collects/pull/scrape the metrics
		ex: NodeExpoter------------------>used to colelct node related metrics [disk , cpu , memory utilization]
		    Kube-state-metrics----------->collect metrics from apr-server [to get info of pods,deplpyments,svc.......]

☑️Promotheus scrapes the information from exporters and stores it in TSDB     [storig metrics in periodic basis -- means which will store the metrics at each time stamp ]		

Grafana default creds -->admin/prom-operator


competitors to promotheus------->Nagios,InfluxDB,Graphite


****to check metrics of Node exporter*********
minikube ssh
curl <ip-of-nodeexporter-service>:9100/metrics


kube_pod_container_status_restarts_total{namespace="default"}

kubectl run busybox-crash --image=busybox -- /bin/sh -c "exit 1"

kube_configmap_created{namespace="kube-system"}

=================================================================
☑️Instrumentation refers to the process of adding monitoring capabilities to your applications, systems, or services.
	application specific metrics----------> Number fo users registered in last 30 days, number of logins per day, no.of http requets to application etc........
🎯Types of Metrics in Prometheus
	1)counter ------------------>metric that always increasing [no.of users registered...]
	2)Gauge -------------------->metrics that have  up/down nature [cpu.memory utilizations..]
	3)Histogram----------------->record the info in buckets [how many https requets took 5 ms , 10 ms , 15 ms ........]
	4)Summary------------------->Summary samples observations and provides a total count of observations, their sum, and configurable quantiles(percentiles).
