Obervability --------> internal state of system [app, infra, network]

disk utilization, cpu utilization, memory utilization
Number of success/failed http requests towards application

3 pillars of Observability
what--->metrics
why---->logs
how---->traces

Metrics---------> Historical data of application [cpu utilization for last 3 months]
logs------------> some amt of information
traces----------> extensive amt of information


==========================
Monitoring vs Observability
==========================

Monitoring------> metrics + alerts + Dashboards.
    Only one pillar of Observability --metrics   
    its an subset of Observability

====================================


Metrics -----------> measurements or data points that tell you what is happening. 
		    For example, the number of steps you walk each day, your heart rate, or the temperature outsideâ€”these are all metrics.

Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting

Exporters---> addons/plug-ins in Promotheus using which it collects/pull the metrics
		ex: NodeExpoter------------------>used to colelct node related metrics
		    Kube-state-metrics----------->collect metrics from apr-server [to get info of pods,deplpyments,svc.......]


competitors to promotheus------->Nagios,InfluxDB,Graphite
