1)What is the difference between variable TF and Terraform TFvars?
variables.tf is where you declare your variables, while terraform. tfvars is where you assign values to those variables.

2) passing tfvars file during run time [ if we are using terraform.tfvars  no need to pass from run time , bydefault tf considers it]
terraform plan -var-file="abcd.tfvars"
