>1. **Git branching strategy**

 > Generally we have 4 branches <br>
 a) main/master ----main branch should always to be up to date <br>
 b) feature  ---------any new feature has to be implemneted here and then merged to main branch <br>
 c) release  --------- it will be derived from main branch to serve customers <br>
 d) hotfix branch----- any urgent fixes has to be made to the exisitng release branch and merged with main & to that release branch <br>

>2. **Git merge vs rebase** <br>
if you want your commits in linear fashion then go with rebase or else merge would be the preferred option. <br>
**linear way** --->rebase <br>
**non linear way** ---> merge
