1)you have given a log file, you have find out IP addresses and count their occurrences.

Here is Python program to do it:

import re
# Define a regular expression pattern for matching IP addresses
ip_pattern = r'\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}'

# Initialize an empty dictionary to store IP addresses and their counts
ip_counts = {}

# Specify the path to your log file
log_file_path = 'your_log_file.log'

# Open the log file and read its contents line by line
with open(log_file_path, 'r') as log_file:
  for line in log_file:
     
    # Use the regular expression pattern to find IP addresses in the line
    ips = re.findall(ip_pattern, line) 

    # Iterate through the list of IP addresses found in the line
    for ip in ips:
      # If the IP address is already in the dictionary, increment its count
      if ip in ip_counts:
        ip_counts[ip] += 1
      # If the IP address is not in the dictionary, add it with a count of 1
      else:
        ip_counts[ip] = 1

# Print the IP addresses and their counts
for ip, count in ip_counts.items():
  print(f'IP Address: {ip}, Count: {count}')
