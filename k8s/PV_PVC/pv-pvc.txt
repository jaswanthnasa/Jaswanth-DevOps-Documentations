PVs provide a way to decouple storage from the lifecycle of pods and allow data to persist beyond the lifetime of individual pods.
PVC used to attach a volume to the pod
PVs can be provisionaed statially or dynamically.
	static------>create PV in advance
	dynamic----->allows PV to create on demand when requested by application 
		     it is facilitated thoguh STORAGE CLASSES

In Kubernetes, Persistent Volumes (PVs) can be used to provide storage for applications running in a cluster. 
The access modes of a Persistent Volume define how the volume can be accessed by the pods.
There are three main access modes:
1. **ReadWriteOnce (RWO)**: The volume can be mounted as read-write by a single node. This is the most common mode for many applications.
2. **ReadOnlyMany (ROX)**: The volume can be mounted as read-only by many nodes. This is useful for scenarios where multiple pods need to read the same data but not modify it.
3. **ReadWriteMany (RWX)**: The volume can be mounted as read-write by many nodes. This is ideal for shared storage scenarios, such as when multiple pods need to write to the same volume.
When defining a Persistent Volume, you specify the access modes in its specification. Keep in mind that the underlying storage solution must support the desired access modes for your PVs to function correctly.		


ReadWriteOnce
	 the volume can be mounted as read-write by a single node.
	 ReadWriteOnce access mode still can allow multiple pods to access the volume when the pods are running on the same node. For single pod access, please see ReadWriteOncePod.
ReadOnlyMany
	the volume can be mounted as read-only by many nodes.
ReadWriteMany
	the volume can be mounted as read-write by many nodes.


PV reclaim policy:
	What happens to associated PV when PVC deleted
	retain---->PV associated to PVC is not automatically deleted or released when PVC is deleted
	delete---->PV associated to PVC is automatically deleted or released when PVC is deleted
