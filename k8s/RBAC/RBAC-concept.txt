In Kubernetes, a Service Account is an object that provides an identity for processes that run in a Pod. This identity is used to interact with the Kubernetes API and other services. Service Accounts are primarily used to control access to the Kubernetes API and to manage permissions through Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).


RBAC is used to manage access to users/Service Accounts  in a Kubernetes cluster


users, service accounts

user management [dev team. qa team]-----> providng roles for each group so that they can haev restricions over the cluster[Admin/devops team have full access]
service management------> managing the access of the services that are running on cluster 



SA/USERS
ROLES/ CLUSTER ROLE [like IAM role in AWS]
ROLE BINDING / CLUSTER ROLE BINDING [like IAM policies in AWS]

K8s doesn't deal with User management , rather offloading to identity providers [ex: linkden singup/login with google with out registarion]


role ----------> to create access to users to access pods,config maps, secrets within NS..for attaching role we use role binding
cluster role --> to create access to users to access pods,config maps, secrets accross k8s cluster....for attaching role we use cluster role binding
