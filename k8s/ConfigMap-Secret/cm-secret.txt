In Kubernetes, ConfigMaps and Secrets are both used to manage configuration data,
 but they serve different purposes and have different security implications.


ConfigMaps
============
ConfigMaps are used to store non-sensitive configuration data. 
This can include environment variables,command-line arguments, or configuration files.
Data is stored in key-value pairs.

approach1: [wihtout volumes]
kubectl exec -it my-pod /bin/bash
# env | grep DB
drwaback-------have to retart containers/pods----leads to traffic loss


approach2[with volumes]
cat DB_PORT | more


Secrets
=========
Secrets are designed to hold sensitive information, such as passwords, tokens, or SSH keys. 
They help keep sensitive data secure.
Data is stored in key-value pairs but is base64-encoded by default for transmission.
