
Helm is a powerful package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies the deployment and management of applications on Kubernetes clusters. 
It uses a concept called "charts," which are pre-configured templates for Kubernetes resources. 

Ubuntu--->apt
k8s----->helm


1)Chart----------->docker image
Chart is a Helm package. It contains all of the resource definitions necessary to run an application, tool, or service inside of a Kubernetes cluster.


2)Repository------>docker hub
Repository is the place where charts can be collected and shared. 


3)Release--------->docker container  
Release is an instance of a chart running in a Kubernetes cluster. 
One chart can often be installed many times into the same cluster. 
And each time it is installed, a new release is created.

refer section : **Helm installs resources in the following order** 


1)helm create <chart-name> --------------> to create a new chart with the <chart-name>

<chart-name>/
├── .helmignore   # Contains patterns to ignore when packaging Helm charts.
├── Chart.yaml    # Information about your chart [Metadata]
├── values.yaml   # The default values for your templates
├── charts/       # Charts that this chart depends on
└── templates/    # The template files
    └── tests/    # The test files
