Extending k8s capabilities [ex: advanced networking,security, loadbalancing,  gitops principles]

	istio/kong--->adds the capabilites of service mesh capability to k8s
	argocd---->adds the capabilites of gitops to k8s
	keycloak--->adds the capabilites of  very tight identity& access manageent [OAUTH, OIDC]

[Native k8s resouces]
pods, services, deployments, ingress----------> out of the box resoures of k8s





allows to extend the capabilities of k8s [extend the API of k8s]----------> adding new API resource to k8s
to achive we have 3 componetns

1)CRD----------------------------------> Defining new type of API to k8s [ ex: developers at istio/kong write CRD ---->YAML file  ]

deployment.yaml [ resouce ]-------------------------> there is a 'Recouse Definition' for this dpeloyment in k8s which validates the written resouce
in istio--->virtual service [custom resource]-------> there is a 'Custom Recouse Definition [CRD]' for this custome resource [CR]  which validates the written resouce

2)CR
3)CUSTOM CONTROLLER------------> it watches for CR [similar to ingress controller which watches for ingress resource]
