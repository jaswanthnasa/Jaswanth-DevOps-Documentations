Docker Compose is a tool that allows you to define and run **multi-container Docker applications**. Using a simple YAML file, you can specify the services, networks, and volumes your application needs, making it easy to configure and manage complex setups. 


  
 **Manage Multi-Container Applications**: Start, stop, and manage multiple containers as a single application with simple commands.



To get started, you typically create a `docker-compose.yml` file and then use commands like `docker-compose up` to launch your application or `docker-compose down` to stop and remove it. It's a powerful way to streamline development and deployment workflows!
